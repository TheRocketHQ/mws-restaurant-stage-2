# PWA

i really don't like how these components are organized,
the main ideia was to let webpack handle the packing, 
still an organization more react-like would be better
since an component organization would allow not only
easier development but also longer support in the long run
so... 
could let it as it is. or try to go further into webpack module...
gonna sleep this off
